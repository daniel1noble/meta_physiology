## **Abstract**

Meta-analysis is a tool that provides comparative physiologists with powerful, unbiased and quantitatively informed answers to topical research questions by synthesising effect sizes across disparate studies. Meta-analysis' core objective and strength is to distill published research results into standardised effect sizes that can be weighted (i.e., by their inverse sampling variance), and which can be compared across broad sets of research designs, study systems and species. Estimating overall effect sizes, and understanding what drives effect variability, provides opportunities to model how organisms will respond to pressing global challenges. Despite this ambition, research designs in comparative physiology can appear, at the outset, as being vastly different to each other (e.g., using different temperatures or treatment dosages). Differences in treatments across studies has led many to believe that meta-analysis is an exercise in comparing "apples with oranges". Here, we dispel this myth by showing how standardised effects sizes can be used in conjunction with powerful multi-level meta-regression models to both account for factors driving differences across studies and make them more comparable. In addition, we formalise effect size measures that provide comparative physiologists with a means to directly make effect measures comparable, removing 'nuisance heterogeneity' without the need to resort to more complex statistical models that may be harder to interpret. We also describe more general approaches that can be usefully applied to a variety of different contexts to derive 'new' effects sizes and sampling variances. The effect sizes and their corresponding sampling variances we describe should help physiologists deal with common treatment differences across studies.  By using effect sizes that account for components of effect heterogeneity, in combination with existing meta-analytic models, comparative physiologists can explore exciting new questions by making results from large-scale data sets collected from the literature more accessible and widely interpretable.

## **Introduction**

A meta-analysis provides quantitatively informed answers to research questions by synthesising research results across studies and identifying sources of variation [@Nakagawa2017; @Gurevitch1999; @Gurevitch2018; @Cooper2009; @Arnqvist1995; @Koricheva2013; @Borenstein2019]. Meta-analysing independent studies provides greater statistical power and precision than what any individual study on its own would be able to provide on a question - particularly given that most empirical studies are already under-powered in many areas of biology [@Forstmeier2017; @Jennions2003; @Button2013]. By expressing study effects on a common scale (i.e., standardised effect size) a meta-analyst can gain broader insight into the direction and efficacy of a particular treatment effect or the strength of a relationship between two variables of interest [@Gurevitch2018; @Koricheva2013]. Quantitative syntheses, including meta-analyses, have provided comparative physiologists with powerful insights on pressing global challenges - from testing whether physiological plasticity can buffer organisms against climate change [e.g, @Seebacher2015] to the degree to which endocrine disrupting chemicals, such as bisphenol A (BPA), impact aquatic organisms [e.g., @WuSeebacher2020].

Meta-analysis is a well-developed research field with a long history in statistics, medicine, psychology and ecology [@Gurevitch2018; @Nakagawa2017; @Glass2015]. It has emerged as the 'gold-standard' across various disciplines for quantitative synthesis and is becoming increasingly more prominent in the field of comparative physiology. Formal meta-analyses are part of a systematic review and involve a systematic literature-based search, extraction of data from studies meeting specific inclusion criteria, and the subsequent calculation of effects sizes from summary statistics provided by papers. A meta-analysis should follow and report upon this entire process carefully to ensure the review process and data collation, are as transparent and reproducible as possible [i.e., see the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses in Ecology and Evolution (PRISMA-EcoEvo) protocol, @ODea2021]. Aside from providing an up-to-date overview of a research field there are three major goals of meta-analysis: 1) to provide an overall mean estimate of a treatment effect or relationship, 2) to quantify effect size variance and understand key drivers explaining differences in effects across studies and 3) attempt to identify gaps and publication biases [@Nakagawa2017; @Gurevitch1999; @Gurevitch2018; @Cooper2009; @Koricheva2013; @Borenstein2019]. A critically important feature of a meta-analysis is its ability to account for sampling error [@Koricheva2013]. The inverse of sampling error variance is used to weight studies, accordingly, in the analysis and make overall estimates more precise. While many meta-analyses might employ unweighted analyses, these studies will not gain greater precision on estimates because sampling variance cannot be formally accounted for in the analysis, even if the overall mean itself is unbiased [@Morrissey2016a]. 

Despite its widespread adoption and well established methodological procedures, meta-analysis is often criticised for mixing 'apples and oranges' -- in other words, mixing effects from studies that lack comparability [@Gurevitch2018; @Arnqvist1995; @Gallo1979; @Carpenter2020; @Stewart2010; @Glass2015]. Lack of comparability could result from studies differing in experimental design, species, measurement variables and sampling units, which can impact the generalisability of meta-analytic results [@Arnqvist1995; @Stewart2010]. Indeed, study specific differences in comparative physiology are widespread. For example, experimental designs can vary in the temperatures that they apply or in the dosages of chemical modifiers used in experimental treatments [e.g., @WuSeebacher2020]. To the uninitiated, this concern might not be unfounded given that heterogenity in effects is often high in ecological and evolutionary meta-analyses [@Senior2016], telling us that the effect size varies a great deal from one population to another. However, to many, the very fact that highly heterogeneous effects exist is a core strength of meta-analysis [@Cooperetal2019; @Borenstein2019; @Gurevitch2018; @Glass2015]. Indeed, exploring the reasons for why effects are likely to vary across studies "...is the spice of life" [p.g., 519; @Cooperetal2019].

The goal of our review is to briefly overview the process of meta-analysis, making a case for why heterogenity in a meta-analysis is a good thing for answering fundamental reserch problems and guiding research directions. We introduce the idea of 'nuisance heterogenity', showing comparative physiologists that it can be comfortably dealt with by re-formalising many existing effect sizes measures and/or by using multilevel meta-regression models. Indeed, a combination of these approaches might often be ideal. We first conduct a survey of published meta-analyses in the field of comparative physiology to gauge methodological and meta-analytic practices -- determining what types of effect sizes are commonly used, how often effect size estimates are impacted by 'nuisance heterogeneity' and whether meta-analytic models (i.e., models that account for sampling variance) are commonly applied. We then formalise alternative effect sizes and their associated sampling variance to provide comparative physiologists opportunities to explicitly incorporate treatment differences into the effect size estimates to ease their interpretation. We then describe how more complex treatment differences, such as dosage differences (which may have non-linear effects) can be accommodated using multilevel meta-regression models. We hope to show how expanding the meta-analytic toolkit for comparative physiologists will provide new opportunities to address global scale problems that attempt to understand how organisms will cope with rapidly changing environments in the future.

## **The Apples and Oranges 'Problem' in Comparative Physiology**

Meta-analysis is always concerned with effect heterogeneity; in other words, the factors that drive differences in the direction and magnitude an of effect within and across studies [@Nakagawa2017; @Gurevitch2018; @Cooperetal2019; @Borenstein2019]. The concept of heterogeneity is vitally important because it tells us how general a specific conclusion is likely to be, how much of the variance we see is the result of real biology (and not just sampling variance), and provides a way to understand what the key biological factors are leading to an effect [@Nakagawa2017; @Borenstein2019]. There are a plethora of phenomena driving effect heterogeneity, some of which are interesting and others that are less so. 

Generally, contributors to effect size heterogeneity fall within a number of broad categories. First, sampling variance contributes to heterogeneity; the variability driven by the inherent uncertainty in sampling a given population. We cannot sample the entire population and nor do we necessarily want to. As a consequence, we need to rely on a sub-sample to estimate a population parameter (e.g., correlation between two traits). How many independent samples we collect impacts our precision in estimating this 'true' effect [@Borenstein2019]. In meta-analysis we formally include sampling variance to remove this source of heterogeneity directly -- hence why having sampling variances for an effect is so important [@Gurevitch2018; @Koricheva2013]. Second, there are sociological factors impacting heterogeneity. These include attitudes towards publishing non-significant results. Low powered studies that do not find an 'effect' or that find an effect in the opposite direction often lead to what is called publication bias [@Jennions2013; @Nakagawa2021b; @Rothstein2005]. Third, there is real biology driving differences in effects. This is particularly true in comparative physiology where different species with varying habitats, life-histories, mating systems and reproductive modes are synthesised. As comparative physiologists, this is the stuff that gets us up every morning! Much variation could result from shared evolutionary history (i.e., phylogeny) or because of the different thermal environments species (or populations) occupy. We can model these biological factors to test predictions from hypotheses that we believe are key players impacting mean effect size and direction. This improves our understanding of the biological world around us, and helps inform on future research directions. Finally, methodological factors are also big contributors to effect variability. In some cases, these methodological factors are of direct interest. For example, the methods for measuring an outcome variable can result in different effects, and it is important we know and understand this as it can determine how experiments are designed in the future. In other cases, methodological factors might be considered 'nuisance heterogeneity' [following from @Cooperetal2019] -- factors we know vary, but are rather unsurprising to us. These can include differences in temperature, pH, dosages, water potential etc. The factors are obviously going to vary and have an impact on the magnitude of an effect, but they might distract from the core interest. In some cases, however, these factors might actually not be 'nuisance' variables but rather the main interest of a synthesis. However, in many cases they can result in a more complicated interpretation of an effect measure then what is desired.

All the various sources of heterogeneity (except sampling variance) all contribute (to varying extents) to the 'apples and oranges' problem often touted as being an issues with some meta-analyses (or quantitative syntheses more generally). Indeed, some of this criticism revolves around combining studies that vary in their quality (e.g., observational vs experimental). Combining standardised effects, while ignoring these sources of heterogeneity can result in the meaning of a meta-analysis not being particularly useful to many. However, many argue that this is just what we are interested in synthesizing [@Cooperetal2019; @Borenstein2019; @Gurevitch2018; @Glass2015]. In the words of Gene Glass, the father of meta-analysis: "Of course it mixes apples and oranges; in the study of fruit nothing else is sensible; comparing apples and oranges is the only endeavor worthy of true scientists; comparing apples to apples is trivial" [p.g., 224, @Glass2015]. @Glass2015's intention was to simply highlight that whether comparing apples and oranges is a good idea simply boils down to the specific question of interest, the population one wishes to make conclusions about and how hetergenous effects actually are. If we are interested in gaining insight into 'fruit' then synthesising apples and oranges is the only thing that makes sense. Instead, if we are interested in generalising only to apples then mixing fruit will not be ideal. In addition, if we want to understand why different 'fruit' vary in their effects, then we can only ask this question by including all fruit [@Borenstein2019]. 

We tend to agree with @Glass2015, and his sentiment is of particular relevance to comparative physiology. For example, if we want to understand the impact of a pollutant on reproduction in aquatic organisms then including aquatic mammals and fish would provide answers to this general question, even if their reproductive biology and physiology are known to differ. By synthesizing diverse study outcomes, it allows us to not just report on overall effects (if the question is relevant to ask), but to understand critical features of the literature, study systems (e.g., different effects of pollutants on fish and mammal reproduction) and approaches that can explain the diversity of effect outcomes observed. In doing so, it provides a richer set of conclusions that can draw attention to important sources of variability that might have otherwise been overlooked. Having said that, it is still very important to understand the limitations and diversity of studies included within a meta-analysis, and how this can affect interpretations made -- an important reason why transparency and reproducibility are such a prominent feature of meta-analysis (or ideally should be) [@ODea2021]. The validity of general conclusions to certain questions (e.g., what is the overall effect of a pollutant on reproduction?) will inevitably depend on the homogeneity of effects being synthesized. If the estimate of an overall effect coincides with low heterogenity estimates then the effects are reasonably consistent [@Borenstein2019]. If, however, an overall effect is accompanied by large heterogenity estimates, then we would shift focus and explore drivers of that heterogeneity. For example, given the very different physiology of aquatic mammals and fish, understanding an overall combined effect on reproduction may not be particularly relevant, and indeed may be misleading. Therefore, understanding overall effects in each of these groups seperately (and whether they differ) will be more useful. It is important to consider these questions when conducting meta-analyses.

Of course, there are certain types of heterogeneity that transcend different questions or that are simply a 'nuisance' to interpreting effects. In other words, if we compare different types of 'apples' is it still fair to synthesize these studies to understand overall effects? This situation might be analogous to a meta-analysis in comparative physiology that attempts to understand the effects of dietary on fish growth across different populations of a widely distributed (cosmopolitan) species. Studies might rear populations of fish under different temperatures, but in the end, they are still all the same fish species, governed by the same thermodynamic effects on growth. In this situation, we might still be interested in understanding overall effects, but we may question whether such a conclusion is sensible given the diversity of temperatures applied. It is not always clear how we should tackle these sources of heterogeneity. If temperature differences are of direct interest, then we should definitely model them. If, however, it is less interesting, than say the diet administered, then it may introduce an unnecessary complication to the interpretation of the effect(s) of interest.  

## **Survey of Meta-Analytic Practices in Comparative Physiology**

As discussed above, different types of questions and experimental approaches will mix 'apples and oranges' to varying extents, and indeed, this heterogeneity (or basket of fruit) is often the main interest to comparative biologists. To better understand the different types of effect sizes being used, their susceptibility to known sources of methodological / environmental variability across studies, and how these sources are controlled we conducted a literature survey. To accomplish this goal, we searched for meta-analyses and comparative analyses that tackled questions using physiological data compiled from animal studies across multiple species. We were specifically interested in asking: 1) what type of effect size was used within the quantitative synthesis? 2) based on the methods provided, was the effect size likely susceptible to continuous variation in how treatments were applied (e.g., for contrast-based effects) or the conditions under which traits were measured (i.e., for correlations) across studies? 3) If so, was the variation resulting from treatment differences accounted for in the effect size or during analysis?, and finally, 4) how were effect sizes analysed in the quantitative synthesis, were these weighted analyses, and what program was used for analysis? We also recorded whether publication bias and sensitivity analyses were conducted, if data were publicly available, where it was stored, and if so, if it was usable (i.e., in a machine readable format).

#### *Literature Search and Survey Data Collection*

All searches were conducted in Scopus between May 16 - 18, 2021. Briefly, we first did a series of pilot searches (detailed in Supplementary Materials) to refine our search query [See @Foo2021 for an overview of this process]. We searched for studies that included: 'meta-analysis', 'meta regression' , 'comparative analysis', 'comprehensive analysis' 'global analysis' or 'macro physiology' in their title and abstract, restricting our search to key comparative physiology journals (detailed in Table X - Supplementary Materials) within the last 6 years. We expected this to provide a contemporary overview of quantitative syntheses in comparative physiology while making the survey and screening feasible. We acknowledge that this may have missed some important, and influential, quantitative synthesis in the field of comparative physiology, but likely provided a random sample to inform on the questions we sought to address (see below).

We included quantitative syntheses, including meta-analyses (*sensu stricto*), that were focused on comparative physiological questions only. Narrative reviews and comments were not considered because they did not collate quantitative data from the literature. Studies needed to have collected physiological trait data from the literature including traits, such as hormones, thermal physiology (CTmax, CTmin, thermal preferences, thermal breadth, LT50, lethal thresholds), metabolic rates (routine, maximum, and minimum metabolic rate, aerobic scope), enzyme reaction rates and concentrations, oxidative stress and consequences (e.g., DNA damage, teleomere attrition), performance measurements (e.g., heart rates, sprint speed, swim speed, growth rates), body composition (e.g., fatty acid profiles) and immune traits (e.g., cell function, antibodies, ect.). Studies were also included if they measured the relationship between physiological traits and body size (e.g., metabolic scaling), reproductive allocation, or survival / mortality across taxa. Studies on behavior were only included if the synthesis was explicitly interested in the proximate physiological drivers of behavioral variation. We also included meta-analyses that quantified plasticity in physiological traits across taxa for the purpose of understanding adaptive plasticity in response to environmental variation. While many studies in comparative physiology collect data as part of a comparative analysis, we focus here only on studies collating data from existing literature because this is the major data source for quantitative synthesis. Quantitative syntheses interested in phenology, bio-mechanics, sexual size dimorphism (i.e., SSD, except if the study was interested in sexual differences in physiological traits), those focused on validating physiological methodology, or characterising population genetic structure, gene transcription and quantitative genetics were excluded. There were also meta-analyses that focused on colour evolution and contrast which varied in their goals but were most often not focused on physiological questions. As such, these studies were also exclude. We restricted our focus to animal studies because plant synthesis papers were often only focused on ecological (e.g., quantified changes in abundance and distribution of species) or agricultural questions (e.g., studies on soil microbial function, nitrogen and phosphorus capture, methane output and greenhouse gas emissions).

All title, abstract and full text screening was done by two people (DWAN and ML). Any conflicts or disagreements were resolved by discussion and a consensus on a paper was reached. Out of the 417 papers, 79 full texts were screened and we included a total of 62 for final data extraction. For full details on the search strings used, dates searched, the number of papers found, and our PRISMA flowchart (along with reasons for exclusion at the full text stage) we refer readers to the *Supplementary Materials*. To address our questions, we categorised effect sizes as falling into the following categories: Response Ratio (lnRR), Standardised Mean Differences (SMD; e.g., Hedges d, g or Cohen's d), Correlation or Fisher's Z -transformed Correlation, Regression Slopes (Slopes), Risk Ratios, or whether the paper analysed the raw data or summary statistics directly (i.e., means/proportions) (which we label as raw/mean/proportion). For all other effects we labelled as 'other'. To determine whether effect sizes were likely to vary based on some underlying continuous variable or were dependent on the context in which traits were measured, we assessed whether authors: 1) acknowledged this explicitly in the paper or 2) accounted for it in their models. If it was not clear, two of us (DWAN & PP) discussed the paper, and made a decision. For example, trait means, such as ectothermic metabolic rate (i.e., raw/mean/proportion-based effect size), will vary depending on the temperature being measured, the magnitude of differences between two treatments (e.g, contrast-based effect sizes - SMD or lnRR) might depend on the temperature or dosage used in treatments, and the strength of relationship between two variables (e.g., correlation between behaviour and metabolism) might depend on the temperature context under which metabolic rate or behaviour were measured. Given the high heterogeneity in effects used in comparative physiology, we expected this to be common to most effect sizes, however, it has not been formally quantified. We categorised the types of staitsical models fit in each study as: 1) fixed-effect meta-analysis; 2) random effects meta-analysis (i.e., intercept only model, but has random study effects); 3) multi-level meta-analysis (i.e., intercept only model, but has multiple random effect levels such as study, species, observation-level random effects); 4) meta-regression models (i.e., a multilevel or random effect model with fixed effects - including random effects); 5) weighted regression models, inluding mixed effect models; and 6) linear regression models (including linear and generalised linear mixed effect models, and phylogenetic least squares models). Notably, only model types 1-5 are weighted models.

#### *Common Effect Sizes and Sampling Errors that are Useful in Comparative Physiology*

Meta-analysis requires comparative physiologists to make use of effect sizes that are suitable for answering their specific question. The key features of all effect sizes used in meta-analyses are that they are: 1) statistical parameters that have been placed on a common scale so that they can be compared across studies and 2) that they have some associated measure of precision (i.e., sampling variance)[@Koricheva2013; @Borenstein2009; @Schmid2021]. Effect sizes in comparative physiology are quite variable; they can be the mean difference between two groups (e.g., difference in mean between a control and treatment group - see @WuSeebacher2020), the slope of a regression (e.g., between body size and metabolic rate), a correlation between two variables, or even the raw mean (or variance) itself (e.g., comparing CTmax or CTmin across species - see @Sunday2014). In many cases, multiple types of effect sizes might be used depending on the question. For example, studies interested in the effect of temperature on some physiological trait that have measured the trait across studies experimentally manipulating temperature could analyse the mean 'effect' by creating contrast-based effect sizes or by analysing the mean in each temperature treatment. The choice as to which one to use will boil down to the types of data available from primary studies, the specific question of interest and whether studies are observational or experimental in nature. Considering our temperature example above, if we are interested in the magnitude of change between temperature treatments, we may want to use a contrast-based effect size, such as the log response ratio $\ln{RR}$. If we are instead interested in how the mean of some physiological trait changes with temperature we may instead model the mean itself. In the latter scenario, so long as all the means are measured in the same units (e.g., ; or can be converted to the same units) then the mean may provide the desired answer to a given question. We provide details on different effect measures and associated sample sizes in Table \@ref(tab:tablea).

#### *Expanding the Scope of Effect Size Metrics in Comparative Physiology*

As is clear from Table \@ref(tab:tablea) none of the effect measures control for 'nusance heterogenity'. For example, the magnitude of response between two treatment groups for lnRR or SMD might depend on just how different the tempeartures, dosages, pH or water potential applied in each treatment. Even modelling just the mean often needs to account for 'nusance heterogenity'. For example, standard metabolic rate (SMR) is tempearture dependent. As such, one needs to standardise the temperature measurement to compare across studies [@White2006; @Uyeda2017, if, of course, temperature is not of interest in of itself]. While we could of course model this explictly, this may not always be desireable. It can often be useful to standardise the effect to both ease its interpretation and simplify modelling. In Box 1 we provide readers with guidance on how comparative physiologists can apply corrections to the effect measure itself. We highlight two examples in the box focusing mainly on generality. Below, we show using a common well understood effect measure of interest to comparative physiologys, $Q_{10}$ how we can formalise a common effect size measure $lnRR$ to capture this 'nusance variation'. 

#### *Comparing Changes in Mean Physiological Rates, $Q_{10}$*
A very common occurrence in comparative physiology is to manipulate the temperature organisms experience and measure some physiological rate (e.g., metabolic rate). Using normal effect size measures (see above) would result in the effect sizes varying in the types of temperatures applied within and across across studies contributing to 'comparability' issues. As such, it is often of interest to standardize effects by temperature. One common effect size measure already used in comparative physiology to compare physiological rates is $Q_{10}$ [e.g., @Rodgers2021; @Seebacher2015; @Havird2020], which describes the multiplicative change in physiological rates across a 10°C temperature change. Higher $Q_{10}$ values indicate larger changes in physiological rates. Currently, however, we do not have associated sampling variances derived for $Q_{10}$ making it challenging to make use of the full power of weighted meta-analytic models. Interestingly, $Q_{10}$ can be seen as a variant of *lnRR*, meaning that we can derive a $Q_{10}$ based effect size and sampling error using the well known mathematical properties of *lnRR*. This opens up the meta-analytic toolbox and improves upon our ability to account for well known sources of non-independence that are typical in meta-analysis [@Lajeunesse2011; @Noble2017].

Prior to showing how the relevant $Q_{10}$ effect size can be calculated it can be helpful to understand its similarities to *lnRR*. The *lnRR* described by @Hedges1999 and extended by @Lajeunesse2015 and can be calculated as follows [but see also @Senior2020]:

$$
\begin{equation} 
  \begin{aligned}
  lnRR = ln\left ( \frac{X_{1}}{X_{2}}\right )
  \end{aligned}
  (\#eq:lnRR)
\end{equation} 
$$

$$
\begin{equation} 
  s_{lnRR} = \left ( \frac{SD_{1}^2}{N_{1}X_{1}^2}\right ) + \left ( \frac{SD_{2}^2}{N_{2}X_{2}^2}\right )
  (\#eq:slnRR)
\end{equation} 
$$ In equation \@ref(eq:lnRR), $X_{1}$ is the mean of group 1, often a control group, where as $X_{2}$ is the mean of group 2 (e.g., a treatment group). The mean of $X_{i}$ for group *i* can be any measurement type (e.g. a physiological rate, mass etc) so long as the measurement variable is ratio scale. Log transformation of this ratio makes the effect size normally distributed. <!--- use consistent notations in relation to the table - do you want to put i or not - then you need to put i throughout ---> Equation \@ref(eq:slnRR) is the analytical solution for *lnRR*'s sampling variance where, $SD_{1}^2$ and $SD_{2}^2$ is the sample variance in group 1 and 2, respectively and $N_{1}$ and $N_{2}$ is the sample size in group 1 and 2.

The equations for *lnRR* and its sampling variance allow us to easily extend this to $Q_{10}$ based effect sizes. Recall that $Q_{10}$ is described as follows:

$$
\begin{equation} 
  Q_{10} = \left( \frac{R_{2}}{R_{1}} \right)^{ \left(\ \frac{10^{\circ}C}{T_{2}-T_{1}} \right) }
  (\#eq:q10)
\end{equation} 
$$ Here, $R_{1}$ and $R_{2}$ are mean physiological rates and $T_{1}$ and $T_{2}$ are the temperatures that these rates are measured. Log transformation of equation \@ref(eq:q10) leads to the following log transformed $Q_{10}$:

$$
\begin{equation} 
  lnRR_{Q_{10}} = ln\left( \frac{R_{2}}{R_{1}} \right){ \left(\ \frac{10^{\circ}C}{T_{2}-T_{1}} \right) }
(\#eq:lnq10)
\end{equation} 
$$ Equation \@ref(eq:lnq10) is essentially a temperature corrected equivalent to lnRR when the numerator and denominator are measured at different temperatures. This allows one to compare the mean of two temperature treatments directly regardless of the temperatures that these groups have been measured. Here, we will refer to this as the log $Q_{10}$ response ratio, $lnRR_{Q_{10}}$. Notably, by taking the natural logarithm, there are two statistical advantages: 1) 0 becomes biological meaningful as 0 means two rates are the exactly the same and 'statistically significantly different from 0' means that two rates are significantly different to each other and 2) $lnRR_{Q_{10}}$ is more likely to satisfy the assumption of residual normality than $Q_{10}$ (see @Hedges1999). Also, the recognition of this equivalence means that we can easily calculate the sampling variance for equation \@ref(eq:lnq10) as follows:

$$
\begin{equation} 
  s_{lnRR_{Q_{10}}} = \left( \frac{SD_{2}^2}{R^2_{2}N_{2}} + \frac{SD_{1}^2}{R^2_{1}N_{1}} \right){ \left(\ \frac{10^{\circ}C}{T_{2}-T_{1}} \right) }^2
  (\#eq:Vlnq10)
\end{equation} 
$$

#### *Formalising Effect Size Metrics that Compare Changes in Variability Across Treatments in the Presence of "Nuisance Heterogenity"*

@Nakagawa2015 recently proposed analogous effect size estimates to *lnRR* that allow for comparisons of changes in variance between two groups, the log variance ratio (*lnVR*) and the log coefficient of variation (*lnCVR*). Like *lnRR*, *lnVR* and *lnCVR* are ratios that describe the relative difference in trait variability between two groups. We refer readers to @Nakagawa2015 for the equations describing *lnVR* and *lnCVR*, but these can easily be extended to their $Q_{10}$ analogues (and associated sampling variances) as follows:

$$
\begin{equation} 
lnVR_{Q_{10}} = ln\left( \frac{SD_{2}}{SD_{1}} \right){ \left(\ \frac{10^{\circ}C}{T_{2}-T_{1}} \right) }
(\#eq:lnq10VR)
\end{equation} 
$$ $$
\begin{equation} 
s_{lnVR_{Q_{10}}} = \left( \frac{1}{2\left( N_{2}-1 \right)} + \frac{1}{2\left(N_{1} - 1\right)} \right){ \left(\ \frac{10^{\circ}C}{T_{2}-T_{1}} \right) }^2
(\#eq:slnq10VR)
\end{equation} 
$$

Equations \@ref(eq:lnq10VR) and \@ref(eq:slnq10VR) describe the change in physiological rate variance (eqn \@ref(eq:lnq10VR)) across a 10°C temperature change along with its sampling variance (eqn \@ref(eq:slnq10VR)). While this is a useful metric, as discussed by @Nakagawa2015 there is often a strong mean-variance relationship that needs to be accounted for in analysing changes in variance. As such, we can calculate the coefficient of variation, which standardises changes in variance for changes in means as follows:

$$
\begin{equation} 
lnCVR_{Q_{10}} = ln\left( \frac{\text{CV}_{2}}{\text{CV}_{1}} \right){ \left(\ \frac{10^{\circ}C}{T_{2}-T_{1}} \right) }
(\#eq:lnq10CVR)
\end{equation} 
$$ $$
\begin{equation} 
s_{lnCVR_{Q_{10}}} = \left[ \frac{(\text{SD}_{1})^2}{N_{1}({R}_{1})^2} + \frac{(\text{SD}_{2})^2}{N_{2} ({R}_{2})^2} + \frac{1}{2\left( N_{1}-1 \right)} + \frac{1}{2\left(N_{2} - 1\right)} \right]{ \left(\ \frac{10^{\circ}C}{T_{2}-T_{1}} \right) }^2
(\#eq:slnq10CVR)
\end{equation} 
$$

where $CV$ is the coefficient of variation defined as $SD / R$. Whether one choose to use SD or CV-based effect size depends on questions at hand [See @Nakagawa2015; @Senior2020].

Our example using $Q_{10}$, a well known effect measure in comparative physiology, shows how common effect size measures can be re-formalised to account for 'nuisance hetreogenity', in this case temperature. We can apply similar approaches to other commonly used effect size metrics. We describe more generally how this can be done in Box 1, applying similar principles to standardise temperature differences for slopes and for standardised mean differences.

## **Meta-Analytic Models to Control for and Investigate Heterogeneous Effects Within and Across Studies**

It will not be possible to derive an effect size that completely controls for 'nuisance' heterogeneity at the effect size level all the time. This limitation is partly because treatment effects may not be simple linear or exponential functions of the mean response making the effect sizes we discuss above unsuitable [e.g., thermal performance curves; @Noble2018]. For example, dosages applied to treatments can follow quite complex non-linear relationships (e.g., quadratic relationships) in relation to some mean response. When this occurs we recommend comparative physiologists apply meta-regression approaches, controlling for 'these known treatment differences 'nusiance heterogenity' as a moderator. In many cases, this will be the easiest, or even preferred approach because exploring drivers of heterogenity will be the main interest in most meta-analyses. Nonetheless, there are some simple statistical approaches a meta-analyst can use to then make the overall effects interpretable, allowing one to control for 'nuisance heterogenity', while also allowing other biological moderators of interest to be tested [@Schielzeth2010]. Before diving into meta-regression models, we will first overview the meta-analytic approaches or steps commonly used.

#### *Multi-level Meta-Analysis when the Overall Effect is of Interest*

One of the main goals of meta-analysis is to obtain an overall meta-analytic mean effect size estimate and some form of uncertainty around that mean, like a 95% confidence interval (CI). Including a prediction interval (PI) can also be quite useful because, in the context of a meta-analysis, it provides the range of effect size values we might expect to observe if a new study were to be conducted [@Nakagawa2021c]. Estimating an overall mean along with 95% CI (or PI) is generally done with a simple random effects or multilevel meta-analytic model that accounts for effect size sampling error [@Nakagawa2017; @NakagawaSantos2012]. More often than not, meta-analyses in comparative physiology will have complex hierarchical structure. For example, multiple effect sizes may be taken from a single study on different traits measured on the same individuals, or come from many different species that share an evolutionary history [@Noble2017]. As such, it is far more likely that comparative physiologists will need to apply a multi-level meta-analytic model to control for the various sources of non-independence [@NakagawaSantos2012; @Song2021; @Nakagawa2021; @Noble2017]. Multilevel models are also extremely useful in describing the various sources contributing to effect size variance. For the purpose of our discussion, we will assume the meta-analyst plans to use more advanced multilevel models. Having said that, it maybe sufficient for many meta-analyses to make use of traditional random effects models. We refer readers to excellent reviews and books that overview the distinctions between common (fixed) effect, random effect and multilevel models and when one might want (or not want) to apply these models [@Nakagawa2017; @NakagawaSantos2012; @Koricheva2013; @Borenstein2009; @Schmid2021].

Assume that we are interested in understanding the overall effect of, say, stress (i.e., corticosterone - CORT) on reproduction [e.g., see @Podmola2018] we might extract data from studies manipulating corticosterone in bird eggs. Of course, these studies are diverse, apply different dosages of corticosterone and are working across many species. If the studies are experimental in nature, than a standardised effect size, such as $ln_{RR}$ or Hedges' *d* might be applicable. We then might fit an overall, multilevel meta-analytic model as follows: 
$$
\begin{equation} 
Y_{i} = \beta_{0} + a_{k[i]} + sp_{k[i]} + s_{j[i]} + e_{i} + m_{i}\
(\#eq:MLMM)
\end{equation} 
$$ 
$$
\begin{equation} 
a_{k[i]}\sim N(0, \sigma^{2}_{phylogeny}A),\
sp_{k[i]}\sim N(0, \sigma^{2}_{species}I),\
s_{j[i]}\sim N(0, \sigma^{2}_{study}I),\
e_{i}\sim N(0, \sigma^{2}_{residual}I),\
m_{i} \sim N(0, v_{i})\
(\#eq:dist)
\end{equation} 
$$

<!--- you can use ni instead of spi??? - also refer to this paper in this seciton which really justify or even nessates people using this rather complext model and having a and sp are rather crtical! - https://ecoevorxiv.org/su4zv/--->

where $Y_{i}$ is the *i*th effect size (*i* = 1 ... $N_{ES}$, the number of effect sizes), $\beta_{0}$ is the overall meta-analytic mean, $a_{k[i]}$ is the phylogenetic effect (a random effect) for species *k* applied to effect size *i*. Phylogenetic effects are assumed to be normally distributed deviates sampled from a distribution with a mean of 0 and variance $\sigma^{2}_{phylogeny}$ [i.e., *N*$(0, \sigma^{2}_{phylogeny}A)$], where A is a phylogenetic correlation matrix derived from a phylogenetic tree, $sp_{k[i]}$ is the species-specific effect for the *k*th species applied to effect size *i*, $s_{j[i]}$ is the study-specific effect for the *j*th study applied to effect size *i*, $e_{i}$ is the effect size-specific effect (or within study effect, or residuals) for the *i*th effect size, and $m_{i}$ is the sampling variance effect around the *i*th effect as a result of variation in precision among each effect sizes, $v_{i}$, which is known as the sampling variance for effect. This model is a 'weighted' multilevel meta-analysis model because the estimation of the overall meta-analytic mean, $\beta_{0}$, is weighted by the inverse sampling variance of each effect size. The fact that we can obtain an overall estimate of sampling variance (i.e., $\sigma^2_{m}$) is very important because it provides a way for us to understand just how much variation in effects are the result of sampling differences across studies versus other, potentially important sources of variation such as differences in the methods applied, species differences or even real biological effects that impact the effect size a study is likely to observe [@Nakagawa2017; @NakagawaSantos2012]. This is formalised in what we call 'heterogeneity analysis' which we describe below. Importantly, this model provides us with the answer to our overall question: Across all the species and studies manipulating egg corticosterone, how much of an overall effect does corticosterone have on reproduction relative to control conditions? <!--- don't we need to mention in the case of VCV for mi--->

Of course, the overall effect does not provide us a way to interpret its magnitude in the context of how much CORT has been applied in the treatment. The most we can say about it, is that the effect is small, moderate or large out of the sample of effect sizes extracted from this set of studies. In the next section, we show how to 'correct' the overall effect size so that its interpretation is more meaningful.

#### *Multilevel Meta-regression to Understand Variation and Improve Interpretation*

Heterogeneity among effects that result from known differences in how treatments are applied can also be dealt with using multilevel meta-regression models. Multilevel meta-regression models include all the same random effects that we have already discussed, but they also include fixed effects (i.e., predictors or moderators) that attempt to explain changes in the mean effect size. In other words, we can modify our multilevel meta-analytic model to turn it into a multilevel meta-regression model as follows:

$$ Y_{i} = \beta_{0} + \sum \beta_{j}x_{j} + a_{k[i]} + sp_{k[i]} + s_{j[i]} + e_{i} + m_{i} $$ where $\sum \beta_{j}x_{j}$ is simply the sum of all effects for all moderators (fixed effects), $x_{j}$. All other notation is the same as described above. Importantly, the variable $x_{j}$ could be any moderator collected from studies, including dosage, temperature, salinity, or pH. Some moderators will be at the level of the study (e.g., was the study experimental or observational in nature) but others could be taken at the effect size level (i.e., was the effect derived using a temperature of 23°C or 35°C). By including these moderators in a meta-regression model, the interpretation of the overall meta-analytic mean, $\beta_{0}$, changes. For example, assume we collected the change in CORT dosage relative to a control group (i.e., in uL / g) for our meta-analysis on egg CORT effects on bird reproduction. If the untransformed dosage, $x_{j}$, is included in the model then the overall meta-analytic mean estimate, $\beta_{0}$, would be the mean effect of CORT relative to a control treatment, on reproduction when the dosage difference between the treatment and control group is 0 uL /g. Of course, this interpretation does not make much sense. We can, however, apply some simple transformations to make the overall mean estimate more intuitive to understand with the added benefit that it can help improve the interpretation of non-linear parameters estimated by the model [@Schielzeth2010; @GelmanHill2007]. One simple transformation would be to centre the variable $x_{j}$, by subtracting each value from the mean to create a new input variable (i.e., $c_{i}=x_{i}-\bar{x}$, where the subscript *i* denotes each individual effect size dosage). The new variable, $c_{j}$, is now centered on the mean and can replace $x_{j}$. When the model is refit with $c_{j}$ the estimated $\beta_{0}$ can now be more intuitively interpreted as the overall mean effect of CORT on reproduction at an average dosage difference between treatment and control groups. Importantly, by centering, we retain the original units (uL / g) of the variable, which can be very useful to allow for a more general interpretation of the effect magnitude. Of course, if one is not interested in the magnitude of effect, we could also change our question and simply model mean reproductive output as a function of dosage (often what are referred to as 'arm-based' meta-analytic models). Here, one can model the mean for each group (i.e., control and treatment group), and account for the known sampling variance associated with each group mean. Dosage, or other continuous variables like temperature, can then be modeled (accounting for sampling variance) to understand how mean reproductive output changes. It is important to recognise that all means need to be comparable and that these models are more complex to fit. While they can be equivalent to 'contrast-based' models, they require complex interactions to be estimated [@Nakagawa2015].

Centering moderator variables, like temperature and dosage, not only provides a way to make the overall mean effect more interpretable in the face of treatment heterogeneity, but it also allows more complex relationships to be fit without compromising interpretations, including non-linear parameters and interactions (e.g., polynomials). In other words, linear / main effects can still be interpreted normally in the presence of non-linear / interactions fit in the model [@Schielzeth2010; @GelmanHill2007]. This can be particularly powerful when more complex, nonlinear, dosage relationships exist. We provide examples in the online supplementary material (with R code) to show readers how the models we describe above can be fit, and how, meta-analytic means can be adjusted for treatment heterogeneity.

#### *Heterogenity Analysis: How Much Effect Size Variation Actually Exists?*

Quantifying effect size heterogeneity (i.e., effect size variance) provides the impetus for exploring hypotheses that are thought to explain why effects might vary within and across studies, while also providing context for interpreting the generality of effects. There are a number of measures commonly used to quantify effect size heterogenity [@Borenstein2019], however, in ecological and evolutionary meta-analysis, heterogeneity is often calculated and reported as $I_{total}^2$ as follows (if using a multilevel meta-analytic model as we describe above):

$$ 
I^2_{total} = \frac{\sigma^2_{study} + \sigma^2_{phylogeny} + \sigma^2_{species} + \sigma^2_{residual}}{\sigma^2_{study} + \sigma^2_{phylogeny} + \sigma^2_{species} + \sigma^2_{residual} +\sigma^2_{m}}
$$

<!--- be consistent with sigma notations above - actually total - m may sometimes not work - so best adding up all like this, which was the core finding in Nakagawa & Schielzeth's R2 --->

where $\sigma^2_{total} = \sigma^2_{study} + \sigma^2_{phylogeny} + \sigma^2_{species} + \sigma^2_{residual} +\sigma^2_{m}$ is the total effect size variance  and $\sigma^2_{m}$ is the sampling error variance calculated as:

$$
\sigma_{m}^2 = \sum w_{i}\left( k-1\right) / \left[ \left( \sum w_{i}\right)^2  + \sum w_{i}^2\right]
$$

where *k* is the number of studies and the weights, $w_{i} = \frac{1}{v_{i}}$, can be calcualted as the inverse of the sampling variance ($v_{i}$) for each effect size, *i*.  

Quantifying heterogeneity using $I_{total}^2$ provides a formal way to assess the relative amount of variation that is the result of 'true' biological or methodological differences as opposed to simply chance (i.e., sampling variance) [@NakagawaSantos2012; @Higgins2002]. In other words, $I_{total}^2$ can be thought of as the percentage of variance between effect sizes that cannot be attributable to sampling error [@Higgins2002]. We can only calculate this metric if we have an estimate of the sampling variance for a given effect measure because only then can we quantify the proportion of variation that is the result of sampling variability. @Senior2016 have shown that total heterogeneity is often extremely high in ecological and evolutionary meta-analysis (\~91%), suggesting that effect measures vary widely across and within studies. Some of the variation is clearly the result of working with different species or strains, different traits and different outcome measures, however, some of this variation also arises because of methodological differences across studies that might be related to the dosages or temperatures used for treatments. Formally quantifying and presenting heterogeneity estimates from meta-analytic models can provide a way to understand the major drivers of effect size variation by allowing researchers to produce various $I^2$ estimates which can be formally compared within and across studies. For example, we could fit the multilevel model described above to understand what proportion of variation is the result of, say, 'study' effects following @NakagawaSantos2012: $I^2_{study} = \frac{\sigma^2_{study}}{\sigma^2_{total}}$ where $\sigma^2_{study}$ is the study specific variance. 

Many readers will notice the similarities between $I^2$ and $R^2$ [@Nakgawa2013; @Nakagawa2010]. If we want to formally assess how much effect size variation is the result of methodological factors, such as temperature and dosage differences applied across studies, then we could fit our multilevel meta-regression model, including dosage or temperature (linear, quadratic or even more complex fits), and estimate how much variation is explained by these fixed effects following @Nakgawa2013.

$$ R^2_{marginal} = \frac{\sigma^2_{fixed}}{\sigma^2_{fixed} + \sigma^2_{study} + \sigma^2_{phylogeny} + \sigma^2_{species} + \sigma^2_{residual}}$$

Note that this formula does not include $\sigma^2_{m}$ as sampling error variance is assumed to be known in meta-analysis as explained above. When including continuous moderators, such as dosage, temperature, salinity, and even pH, $R^2_{marginal}$ provides a formal means to assess just how much variation in effects is the result of 'nuisance' heterogeneity at the effect size level. Other biological moderators of interest could also be included as fixed effects and $R^2_{marginal}$ calculated for each independently or all together. Importantly, moderators could be those that explain variation at the effect size level (i.e., dosage, temperature) or they could explain variation at the study or species level (e.g., reproductive mode, endothermy etc). $R^2_{marginal}$, or how we like to think of it, $R^2_{'nuisance'}$, maybe a useful measure to help readers understand just how much effect variation can result from the specific treatment application. If the heterogeneity is high as a result of, say, dosages differences, then it is clear that the choice of dosage within and across studies will have a critical impact on the effect of interest. Comparative physiologists intersted in implementing thse calculations can do so using our packages `orchaRd` [@Nakagawa2021c] or `metaAidR` (https://github.com/daniel1noble/metaAidR).

Heterogenity described using $I^2$ measures can be useful for understanding the relative contributions of different factors to effect size variation, however, prediction intervals might be more appropriate in many cases [@Nakagawa2021c; @Borenstein2019]. Unlike $I^2$, prediction intervals (PI's) are probably more meaningful in the context of meta-analysis because they explicitly incorperate measures of dispersion around a mean effect size providing information about the likely effect size one can expect if we were to randomly sample a new population. For example, assume that we were interested in the overall impact of salinity stress in freshwater fish. To tackle this question, we collected experimental studies measuring freshwater fish swim performance under high salinity treatments (~15-20ppm NaCl) compared to freshwater (~0ppm NaCl) controls and used SMD to quantify the magnitude of effect salinity had on swim performance. We conduct a meta-analysis and estimate an overall SMD of 0.50 with a prediction interval of 0.05 to 0.85. The PI indicates that effects can vary widely from as low as an SMD of 0.05 to as high as an SMD 0.95, depending on the population. In otherwords, if we were to repeat a study we would expect a new effect to fall within the range of 0.05 and 0.85, 95\% of the time [@Borenstein2019; @Nakagawa2021c]. This is a very intutive interprettaion of how variable effects are, yet PIs are often not reported in meta-analyses [@Nakagawa2021c].

## **Conclusions and Future Directions**
Comparative physiologists are interested in meta-analysing effects across a diversity of species, experimental approaches / designs and environments. While an overall meta-analytic mean may be of interest, more often than not, understanding the drivers of effect size heterogeneity will be the primary interest. However, obvious drivers of effect size heterogeneity, such as temperature and dosage differences across studies, may not really be of interest. Indeed, comparative physiologists are likely to want an effect size or analytical approach that allows them to remove these 'nuisances'. Here, we provide comparative physiologists with a set of tools to deal with 'nuisance heterogeneity' by creatively 'reinventing' standard effect sizes or using meta-regression models. Of course, nuisance heterogeneity might in of itself be the main interest, in which case standard meta-regression approaches will work sufficiently. However, in many cases, comparative physiologists might simply want to focus on bigger, more interesting biological drivers of effect size direction and magnitude. However, estimating complex meta-regression models with a multitude of fixed effects might result in more challenging model interpretation. As such, a combined approach, where some of the known heterogeneity is dealt with by deriving a variant effect size and associated sampling variance, and other biologically interesting moderators are fit in a meta-regression model, might be the desired. Indeed, this may even be a necessity to simplify the model. We hope the set of tools we describe here provide clarification around sourfes of heterogenity and provides ways to help comparative physiologists to communicate effect measures more richly to help guide our understanding and decisions around pressing global challenges.

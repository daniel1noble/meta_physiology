## **Abstract**

Meta-analysis is a tool that provides comparative physiologists with powerful, unbiased and quantitatively informed answers to topical research questions by synthesising effect sizes across disparate studies. Distilling published research results into standardised effect sizes that can be weighted by their sample size (i.e., inverse sampling variance) and compared across broad sets of research designs, study systems and species is its core objective and strength. Estimating overall effect sizes, and understanding what drives effect variability, provides opportunities to model how organisms will respond to pressing global challenges. Despite this ambition, research designs in comparative physiology can appear, at the outset, as being vastly different to each other (e.g., using different temperatures or treatment dosages). Differences in treatments across studies has led many to believe that meta-analysis is an exercise in comparing “apples with oranges”. Here, we dispel this myth by showing how standardised effects sizes can be used in conjunction with powerful multi-level meta-analytic models to both account for factors driving differences across studies and make them more comparable. In addition, we derive new effect size measures that provide comparative physiologists with a means to directly make effect sizes comparable without the need to resort to more complex statistical models that may be harder to interpret. Our ‘new’ effect sizes and corresponding sampling variances help physiologists deal with temperature and dosage differences across studies; allowing researchers to compare both mean differences (e.g., Q10 to compare mean differences in physiological rates over 10 degrees) and associated differences in variance (e.g, SQ10 for comparing variability in in physiological rates over 10 degrees) for physiological traits. The new effect sizes we propose, in combination with existing meta-analytic models, will pave the way for comparative physiologists to explore exciting new questions by making results from large-scale data sets from the literature more accessible and widely interpretable.

## **Introduction**
Meta-analysis provides unbiased and quantitatively informed answers to research questions in comparative physiology by using a transparent and reproducible search strategy to synthesise research results across studies and identify sources of variation [@Nakagawa2017; @Gurevitch2018; @Cooper2009; @Arnqvist1995; @Koricheva2013]. Meta-analysing independent studies provides greater statistical power and precision than what any individual study on its own would be able to provide on a given question - particularly given that most studies are already under-powered in ecological and evolutionary research [@Forstmeier2017; @Jennions2003]. By expressing study effects on a common scale (i.e., effect size) a meta-analyst can gain broader insight into the direction and efficacy of a particular treatment effect or strength of a relationship between two variables of interest [@Gurevitch2018; @Koricheva2013].  A critically important feature of meta-analaysis that provides improved precision when estimating overall effects is the ability to account for sampling error - this can be derived assuming the sampling distribution of a given effect size is known []. 

Despite the widespread adoption and well established methodological procedures of meta-analysis it has been criticised for mixing 'apples and oranges'; in otherwords, mixing effects from studies that lack comparability [@Arnqvist1995; @Gallo1979; @Carpenter2020; @Stewart2010]. Lack of comparability could result from studies differing in experimental design, species, measurement variables and sampling units, which can impact the generalisability of meta-analytic results [@Arnqvist1995; @Stewart2010]. Indeed, study specific differences in comparative physiology are widspread. For example, experimental designs can vary in the temperatures that they apply or in the dosages of chemical modifiers used in experimental treatments [e.g., ]. They often inlcude a diversity of study species. 

The goal of our review is to reassure comparative physiologists that heterogeneity among effect sizes can be comfortably dealt with through modifications of existing effect sizes measures and using multilevel meta-regression models. We first conduct a survey of published meta-analyses in the field of comparative physiology to gauge methodological and meta-analytic practices - assessing what types of effect sizes are commonly used, how often effect size estimates are impacted by continuous treatment differences and whether meta-analytic models (i.e., models that account for sampling variance) are commonly applied. We then introduce new effect sizes and their assocaited sampling variance to provide comparative physiologists opportunities to explictly incorperate treatment differences into the effect size estimates. We then describe how more complex treatment differences, such as dosage differences which may have more complex non-linear effects, can be accomodated using multilevel meta-regression models. Expanding the meta-analtic toolkit for comparative physiologists will provide new opportunities to address global scale problems that attempt to undersatnd how organisms will cope with rapidly changing environments in the future.

Quantifying effect size heterogenity (i.e., effect size variance) provides a pathway to explore hypotheses thought to explain why effect might vary across studies.

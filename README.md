Abstract:

Meta-analysis is a tool that provides comparative physiologists with powerful, unbiased and quantitatively informed answers to topical research questions by synthesising effect sizes across disparate studies. Distilling published research results into standardised effect sizes that can be weighted by their sample size (i.e., inverse sampling variance) and compared across broad sets of research designs, study systems and species is its core objective and strength. Estimating overall effect sizes, and understanding what drives effect variability, provides opportunities to model how organisms will respond to pressing global challenges. Despite this ambition, research designs in comparative physiology can appear, at the outset, as being vastly different to each other (e.g., using different temperatures or treatment dosages). Differences in treatments across studies has led many to believe that meta-analysis is an exercise in comparing “apples with oranges”. Here, we dispel this myth by showing how standardised effects sizes can be used in conjunction with powerful multi-level meta-analytic models to both account for factors driving differences across studies and make them more comparable. In addition, we derive new effect size measures that provide comparative physiologists with a means to directly make effect sizes comparable without the need to resort to more complex statistical models that may be harder to interpret. Our ‘new’ effect sizes and corresponding sampling variances help physiologists deal with temperature and dosage differences across studies; allowing researchers to compare both mean differences (e.g., Q10 to compare mean differences in physiological rates over 10 degrees) and associated differences in variance (e.g, SQ10 for comparing variability in in physiological rates over 10 degrees) for physiological traits. The new effect sizes we propose, in combination with existing meta-analytic models, will pave the way for comparative physiologists to explore exciting new questions by making results from large-scale data sets from the literature more accessible and widely interpretable.

# Survey
We searched for meta-analyses tackling comparative physiological questions that relied on data compiled from n = 5 or more studies using plants or animals. Studies need to have measured a physiological trait, including traits such as hormones, thermal physiology (CTmax, CTmin, Thermal Preferences, Thermal Breadth, LT50, Lethal Thresholds), metabolic rates (routine, maximum, and minimum metabolic rate, aerobic scope), enzyme reaction rates and concentrations, oxidative stress, performance measurements (heart rates, sprint speed, swim speed, growth rates), immune traits (disease load in plants, cell function, antibodies, ect), nitrogen fixation or plant photosynthetic performance, plant biomass (*NOTE WE MAY WANT TO REMOVE THIS TO AVOID TOO MUCH AGRICULTURE), leaf area growth and plant enzyme reactions. We excluded meta-analyses that were focused on ecological questions that quantified changes in abundance and distribution of species and studies that measured microbial or soil function (methane output, soil carbon sequestration, greenhouse gas emissions) because these meta-analyses were not using studies focused on plant and animal physiological function.

Additional information in the question description was: ""For example: A study might have manipulated pH , but the pH applied across the studies vary (one study compared pH 7 to pH 8, whereas another used pH2 to pH8). This should be fairly evident when the effect size is being describe that they use. In this case, we have a situation that, if you use say lnRR, each of these lnRR’s would be based on a different comparison (pH7 to pH8 and pH 2 to pH8). Same problems occur with temperature and dosage. If, say the moderator is categorical with no real meaning on a continuous scale (i.e., high quality vs low quality) then this wouldn’t count as though they controlled or it. Unless, “quality” can be placed on a continuous scale."""
